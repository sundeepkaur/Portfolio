#My Portfolio

	After graduating from PG diploma in April 2020 created my portfolio website using React.js JavaScript library and hosted on web using free web hosting service Heroku.

	Using React Components split the UI into independent sections like header, footer and body where each component would work independently and rendered independently to React DOM without affecting the whole page.

	Used lifecycle methods to execute state of component like mounting, rendering, updating, unmounting.
